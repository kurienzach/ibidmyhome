                    <p style="text-align: justify;">www.ibidmyhome.com is an independent multi-property online auction portal created with an aim to
                    bring together buyers and developers at mutually agreeable price points.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in October 2015, www.ibidmyhome.com is a wholly owned subsidiary of For Innovations In
                    Real Estate (FIRE). The founders’ vision is to promote a transparent price discovery mechanism which is 
                    especially important in a sector where terms like MSP and MRP don’t exist.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Buyers are increasingly taking their home purchase decisions to the online space. A testimony to this 
                    fact is the buoying NRI investments in properties back home. Taking a cue from this behavioral shift, we 
                    invite buyers to place their bids online via a secured payment gateway. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Transparency is a concern in many corners of the real estate industry. Our endeavor is to quell all 
                    apprehensions with thoughtful features likereal time auction statistics. Neutral property advisors are
                    also assigned to help buyers take more informed decisions.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the supply-demand scenario, we will conduct auctions for certain properties. We’ll put them 
                    on auction as and when we see demand picking up in the relevant micro-markets where developers are 
                    willing to sell inventory through us. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Developers across India are invited to make use of this exciting opportunity and enlist their properties 
                    with us. We will ensure that your property selling experience will become smoother with our assistance.
